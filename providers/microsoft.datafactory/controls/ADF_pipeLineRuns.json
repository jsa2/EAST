So no credentials as such will show up in the JSON code. These credentials can never be retrieved by code or visual UI. \r\n-\tIn this report failed credentials are marked as \"safeCredential\": false” the recommendation is store all secrets into Key Vault.\r\n\r\n this will also check for variables containing plaintext secrets"
