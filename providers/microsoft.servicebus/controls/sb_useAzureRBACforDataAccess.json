Authorizing\nusers or applications using OAuth 2.0 token returned by Azure AD\nprovides superior security and ease of use over shared access signatures\n(SAS). With Azure AD, there is no need to store the tokens in your code\nand risk potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft recommends using Azure AD with your Azure Service Bus\napplications when possible. For more information, see the following\narticles:\n\n-   [Authenticate and authorize an application with Azure Active\n    Directory to access Azure Service Bus\n    entities](authenticate-application).\n-   [Authenticate a managed identity with Azure Active Directory to\n    access Azure Service Bus\n    resources](service-bus-managed-service-identity)\n\nYou can disable local or SAS key authentication for a Service Bus\nnamespace and allow only Azure AD authentication. For step-by-step\ninstructions, see [Disable local\nauthentication](disable-local-authentication)\n"
