More advanced analytics can also be performed on exported data (Log Analytics KQL, or other analytics languages)\r\n- Logs should be exported at least for period of 90 days, as this allows looking beyond the default 7-30 days of data retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n **Additional details**\r\n\r\nSource of information (Information from MS docs)\r\n\r\n- [Azure AD Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/)\r\n- [Azure logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview#types-of-platform-logs)\r\n- [Azure Devops Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/audit/azure-devops-auditing?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#export-auditing-events)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n| Log | Layer | Description | status\r\n-|-|-|-\r\nðŸ“œ Azure Active Directory logs | Azure Tenant | Contains the history of sign-in activity and audit trail of changes made in the Azure Active Directory for a particular tenant. | &#9744;\r\n| ðŸ“œ Activity log |Azure Subscription | Provides insight into the operations on each Azure resource in the subscription from the outside (the management plane) in addition to updates on Service Health events.
