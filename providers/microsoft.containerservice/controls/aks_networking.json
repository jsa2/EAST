"Description": "\n\n[Information Source ms docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/kubernetes/cluster-application-security#deploy-to-production-and-apply-kubernetes-security-best-practices)\n\nDefault network settings allow cross namespace - and API server communications from all pods running in the cluster\n\n- Secure intra-pod network traffic with network policies. Apply the principle of least privilege to control network traffic flow between pods in the cluster. For more information, see Secure intra-pod traffic with network policies.\n  \n  **Status**  [ ✅ / ❌]\n\n- Restrict access to the API server using authorized IPs. Improve cluster security and minimize attack surface by limiting access to the API server to a limited set of IP address ranges. For more information, see Secure access to the API server.\n\n  **Status**  [ ✅ / ❌]\n\n- Restrict cluster egress traffic. Learn what ports and addresses to allow if you restrict egress traffic for the cluster. You can use Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall appliance to secure your egress traffic and define these required ports and addresses. To learn more, see Control egress traffic for cluster nodes in AKS.\n\n  **Status**  [ ✅ / ❌]\n\n- Secure traffic with Web Application Firewall (WAF). Use Azure Application Gateway as an ingress controller for Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see Configure Azure Application Gateway as an ingress controller.\n\n  **Status**  [ ✅ / ❌]\n\n**Service list**\n\nService | Web Application Firewall | Advanced Egress Filtering | Inter-Cluster Network Security | Threat Intel\n-|-|-|-|-\nAzure Application Gateway | ✅\nAzure Firewall | | ✅| |✅\nNetwork Policies | | |✅\n\n\n\n\n\n"
